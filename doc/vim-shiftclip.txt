INTRODUCTION      1                                   *vim-shiftclip-intro* {{{1

This plugin provides facilities to align a body of text to the left, right, or
center while respecting the structure of that text.

The Problem~

Vim already supports alignment with its built-in |formatting| commands |left|,
|right| and |center|, but as we will see, these are insufficient for our
purposes.  Let us begin with a demonstration of the deficiency that this plugin
aims to resolve.  It will be observed that these commands operate on lines in a
range independently of other lines in that range.  Let's imagine that we have a
block of text in a Vim buffer.  >

                +---------------------------------------------+

The problem is clear. The |left|, |right|, and |center| commands each justify
lines in their range of operation independently; lines are justified without
respect to the other lines.  These commands work perfectly well in the manner
that they are intended, so it may be a misnomer to call this a problem, but
regardless, we desire a working solution to the proposed circumstance, i.e., we
would like to align a body of text without deforming it.

The Solution~

This plugin is the solution.

A well known rule of Vim is that all user-defined commands must start with an
uppercase letter to distinguish them from builtin commands which mostly start
with lowercase letters.  In that vein, we define three new custom commands
|Left|, |Right|, and |Center| whose names differ from those of the builtin
commands |left|, |right|, and |center| only in their capitalization.  The intent
is for our custom commands to nicely parallel the builtin commands.  These three
new custom commands implement the desired functionality.  As an aside, see
|user-cmd-ambiguous| in the help files.

USAGE             2                                   *vim-shiftclip-usage* {{{1

This plugin provides three commands for aligning blocks of text.  They are also
available from the menu in gvim, under `Plugin -> Shiftclip -> command.`

                                                                         *:Left*
	:[range]Left [indent]

			Left-align the block of text bound by [range],
			preserving structure.  Then pad lines over [range] with
			[indent] number of spaces.  |Left| is like |left|, but
			smarter.

				- The default [indent] is zero spaces.

				- The default [range] is the current line.

                                                                        *:Right*
	:[range]Right [width]

			Right-align the block of text bound by [range] at
			[width] columns, preserving structure.  |Right| is like
			|right|, but smarter.

				- The default [width] is 'textwidth' or 80 when
				  'textwidth' is 0.

				- The default [range] is the current line.

                                                                       *:Center*
	:[range]Center [width]

			Center-align the block of text bound by [range] between
			[width] columns, preserving structure.  |Center| is like
			|center|, but smarter.

				- The default [width] is 'textwidth' or 80 when
				  'textwidth' is 0.

				- The default [range] is the current line.

Inspirations~

This plugin was inspired by a Stack Overflow post.

	https://stackoverflow.com/q/19328975

For a while, I had this in my bashrc. >

 shiftclip () {  #  Align a text snippet to the left

	cut -c $(sed 's/[^ ].*//' $1 | sort | head -n1 | wc -c)- $1;

 }

This only works for left alignment.  I wanted something that could align a block
of text to the left, right, or center, so I wrote this plugin.
